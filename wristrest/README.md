# WristRest

my 3D design of the front wristrest on the right console.  
I didn't find all dimensions, so a lot of the design is by eye.

The mounting bracket is totally my own to fit my project specifically.

Take care when orienting the print on the printbed, the front part should be printed laying on it's side (with supports) to keep the layerlines in the correct orientation.  
  
To connect front and back I'm using M8 bolts and nuts with washers.  
Once everything's assembled I added a bit of not permanent loctite so the nuts don't loosen when moving.  
  
There's an M6 nut incorporated into the height adjustment knob, so an M6 allthread is used inside the backpart.
