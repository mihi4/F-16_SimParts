The elbowrest itself is not modeled since I got a cast version of it years ago and didn't need it.  
Maybe I'll try to model it in the future (when the sim is finished ;-))

There is a small error in the files, the way I built it, there is not enough travel to reach the most upper hole, the elbowrest touches the body before.
